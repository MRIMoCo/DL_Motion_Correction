# DL_Motion_Correction

This repo is the official implementation of our paper "Motion correction in MRI using deep learning and a novel hybrid loss function". The required packages for running the code have been listed in spec-file.txt. We provide test.py for testing our trained model. After install the required packages, you can just using the following command to run the code:

python test.py
